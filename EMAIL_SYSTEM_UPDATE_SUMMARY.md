# 🔔 Email Notification System Update Summary

## 🎯 Changes Made

Based on your requirements, the email notification system has been updated to:

### 1. **Daily Morning Reports (07:00 UTC)**
- **Before**: Sent availability for 7 days ahead
- **After**: Send availability for **today + 2 days ahead** only
- **Norwegian formatting**: Added "I overmorgen" (day after tomorrow) for better readability

### 2. **New Availability Monitoring**
- **Before**: Checked every 10 minutes
- **After**: Check every **20 minutes** for new tee times
- **Smart detection**: Only sends emails for times that are new since this morning's report

### 3. **Local Email Prevention**
- **Before**: Local runs could send emails (causing duplicates)
- **After**: **Local runs are completely disabled** from sending emails
- **Only Render background worker** can send emails

## 🚫 Local Email Sending Disabled

### Why This Change?
- **Prevent duplicate emails** when both local monitor and Render worker are running
- **Centralized email control** from the background worker only
- **Cleaner separation** between data collection (local) and notifications (cloud)

### How It Works:
1. **Local golf monitor** scrapes data and stores in database
2. **Render background worker** reads database and sends emails
3. **No overlap** or duplicate notifications

## 📧 Updated Email Content

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. **Notification Service Updates**
- `notification_service.py` now checks for `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` environment variable
- **Local runs exit immediately** with helpful error message
- **Render environment only** can start the notification worker

### 2. **Email Function Updates**
- `golf_utils.py` `send_email_notification()` function now checks for Render environment
- **Local calls return immediately** without sending emails
- **Prevents accidental local email sending**

### 3. **Timing Changes**
- **Daily reports**: Still at 07:00 UTC, but now only 3 days ahead
- **New availability**: Changed from 10-minute to 20-minute intervals
- **Better performance** and less frequent database queries

## 🚀 Deployment Status

### ✅ What's Ready:
1. **Updated notification service** with new timing
2. **Local email prevention** implemented
3. **Norwegian date formatting** enhanced
4. **Render environment detection** working

### 🔧 What You Need to Do:
1. **Deploy the updated code** to your Render background worker
2. **Verify environment variables** are set correctly
3. **Test the new timing** (20-minute intervals instead of 10)

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### After Deployment:
1. **07:00 UTC daily**: Users receive emails with today + 2 days availability
2. **Every 20 minutes**: System checks for new availability since morning report
3. **Immediate notifications**: New matching times trigger instant emails
4. **No local emails**: Local golf monitor runs without sending emails
5. **Clean separation**: Data collection (local) vs notifications (cloud)

## 🎉 Benefits of This Update

1. **No more duplicate emails** from local vs cloud runs
2. **Focused availability window** (3 days instead of 7)
3. **Better performance** with 20-minute intervals
4. **Cleaner architecture** with clear separation of concerns
5. **Enhanced Norwegian formatting** for better user experience

## 🔍 Testing the Changes

### Local Testing:
```bash
# This should now exit with a helpful message
python notification_service.py
```

### Expected Output:
```
❌ This notification service is designed to run ONLY in Render environment
❌ Local runs are disabled to prevent duplicate email notifications
❌ Deploy this as a Render Background Worker instead
```

### Render Testing:
- Deploy to Render background worker
- Check logs for successful startup
- Verify emails are sent at correct intervals
- Monitor for any errors in the new timing logic

---

**🎯 Summary**: Your email system now sends focused 3-day reports daily, checks every 20 minutes for new availability, and completely prevents local email sending to avoid duplicates. The system is ready for deployment to your Render background worker!
